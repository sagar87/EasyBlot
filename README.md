EasyBlot
========

EasyBlot scans a particular folder and searches for all files that meet the set specifications. Then, the script shows each picture and asks the user to specify crop restrictions. After cropping the picture, the user is asked to annotate the blot. The user sets X- and Y-coordinates and the name of the lanes. Subsequently, the script uses the plot- and the text-function of the marplotlib library to annotate the plot. Finally, the user may save his work to predefined folder.
